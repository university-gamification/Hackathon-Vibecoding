# MCP Servers

This directory contains skeleton servers for Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview
- `echo_server.py`: Minimal MCP-like pattern demonstrating a JSON-RPC style loop over stdio.
- Use this as a starting point to implement your own MCP tools/resources.

> Note: MCP client/tooling varies. This skeleton focuses on a simple JSON-RPC shape to help you plug into your environment of choice.

## Running (development)
```bash
python mcp_servers/echo_server.py
```
Then connect with a compatible MCP client or pipe JSON-RPC requests to stdin.

## Next steps
- Define `list_tools`, `call_tool`, and `resources` to expose your capabilities.
- Add auth or configuration via environment variables.
